A professional, secure, and intelligent Telegram bot to manage backups for multiple **X-UI panels**.
It runs on your external server, connects to your panels (Sanaei, Alireza, Official, etc.) via API, and sends the backup files directly to your Telegram.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🚀 **Quick Installer:** One-line installation command.
- 🧠 **Smart Auto-Discovery:** Automatically detects the correct database path (`/server/getDb`, `/panel/api/...`, etc.) regardless of the X-UI version.
- 🔒 **Secure:** Restricted to the Admin's Telegram ID only. Configuration file is protected.
- 🌍 **Multi-Server:** Manage unlimited servers from a single bot.
- 🔄 **Smart Retry:** Auto-retries failed connections (3 attempts with delay) to handle network instability.
- 🛠️ **No SSH Required:** Connects via the web panel port (HTTP/HTTPS).
-  ⏱ **Dynamic Scheduler:** Change backup intervals directly from the Bot UI (Supports **1 min** to **24 hours**).
- 🔒 **AES Encryption:** All server passwords are automatically encrypted in `servers.json` using Fernet/AES.
- ⚡ **Non-Blocking Core:** Built with `AsyncIO`. The bot never freezes, even when handling 100+ servers or connection timeouts.

## ⚙️ How It Works (Smart Logic)
When you add a server using 

The bot attempts to Login using the provided credentials.

If successful, it scans multiple known API endpoints (e.g., `/server/getDb`, `/panel/api/server/getDb`, etc.).

Once it finds the correct path that returns a valid SQLite file, it saves that path for future use.

This ensures compatibility with almost all X-UI forks (Sanaei, Vaxilu, FranzKafkaYu, etc.).
